      <description>I have been using vim / vim shortcut for nearly everything (Intellij, tmux, chrome browser). These are several tips that I used for everyday &amp;rsquo;s action. My vim configuration is here https://github.com/bubuzzz/my-vim. I cannot remember which plugins that makes the below shortcut effective, thus please checkout my configuration before following the tips
 ^ to jump to beginning of the line. $ to jump to the end of the line. dd to delete the line (use it too much and this makes the D on my mac keyboard is faded away already).</description>

      <description>2017 was a bit weird since I had to involve to many things. Things started to be a mess and became unpredictable. Oh, a guy asked me: You can predict the future? So this is the answer: Yes (and hopefully you can read it here).
My current situation: Working full time for a company, working partime with a good mate, preparing my own startup up and running in the end of this year while staying in a foreign country, under the rush of changing my nationality before next year.</description>

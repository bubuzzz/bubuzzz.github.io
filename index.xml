      <description>2017 was a bit weird since I had to involve to many things. Things started to be a mess and became unpredictable. Oh, a guy asked me: You can predict the future? So this is the answer: Yes (and hopefully you can read it here).
My current situation: Working full time for a company, working partime with a good mate, preparing my own startup up and running in the end of this year while staying in a foreign country, under the rush of changing my nationality before next year.</description>

      <description>I have been using vim / vim shortcut for nearly everything (Intellij, tmux, chrome browser). These are several tips that I used for everyday &amp;rsquo;s action
 ^ to jump to beginning of the line $ to jump to the end of the line dd to delete the line (use it too much and this makes the D on my mac keyboard is faded away already) w to jump forward to each word b to jump backward each word while saving a file, you can send the vim buffer as a parameter to a filter, which actually a bash command in order to execute.</description>

      <description>A software engineer, was born and raised in Vietnam, but moved to Melbourne several years ago.
I spend most of my time in front of computer to hack around all the latest technologies. As a result, I seldom know anything about the place I live ðŸ˜“. This habit should be changed somedays.
My current favourite including react, react-native, node.js and java.</description>
